### Abstract

Mediastinal structure measurements are important for the radiologistâ€™s review of computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) examinations. In the reporting process, radiologists make measurements of diameters, volumes, and organ densities for image quality assessment and risk stratification. However, manual measurement of these features is time consuming. Here, we sought to develop a time-saving automated algorithm that can accurately detect, segment and measure mediastinal structures in routine clinical CTPA examinations. In this study, 700 CTPA examinations collected and annotated. Of these, a training set of 180 examinations were used to develop a fully automated deterministic algorithm. On the test set of 520 examinations, two radiologists validated the detection and segmentation performance quantitatively, and ground truth was annotated to validate the measurement performance. External validation was performed in 47 CTPAs from two independent datasets. The system had 86%-100% detection and segmentation accuracy in the different tasks. The automatic measurements correlated well to those of the radiologist (Pearson's r 0.68-0.99). Taken together, the fully automated algorithm accurately detected, segmented, and measured mediastinal structures in routine CTPA examinations having an adequate representation of common artifacts and medical conditions.
